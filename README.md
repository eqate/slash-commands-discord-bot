# Discord Slash Command Bot

Bot template for discord slash commands

## ⚙️ Installation

1. put bot token in config.py

2. run main.py

>> install necessary packages (if applicable)

## ❓ Project

I will probably not update this unless it gets some traction.

This was only meant for learning how to create a discord bot (with slash commands)

Hope you use this to make a verified and successful bot!
